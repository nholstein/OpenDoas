# OpenDoas: a portable version of OpenBSD's `doas` command

`doas` is a minimal replacement for the venerable `sudo`. It was
initially [written by Ted Unangst](http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/doas)
of the OpenBSD project to provide 95% of the features of `sudo` with a
fraction of the codebase.

This is still a work in progress! Please do not deploy yet in a critical
environment! Of note, `doas` semantics may yet change, and I haven't
performed even a trivial security audit of my additions.

## Building and installing

Building `doas` should be just a simple `make` away.

The included makefile also has an installation target. Installation
requires root access to properly set the executable permissions. You'll
also need to install a `doas.conf` file:

```
make && sudo make install
echo "permit :admin" | sudo tee /etc/doas.conf
```

Oh the irony, using `sudo` to install `doas`!

## About the port

As much as possible I've attempted to stick to `doas` as tedu desired
it. As things stand it's essentially just code lifted from OpenBSD with
PAM based authentication glommed on to it.

I've used cvsync and git-cvsimport to retain the history of the core
source files. I may choose to go back and do the same with some of the
compatibility functions (such as reallocarray.c).

I have found it necessary to make some fixes to the codebase. One was
a segfault due to differences in yacc/bison, others were just minor
fixes to warnings. Once this appears stable, I may try to upstream some
of these.

Currently, this is only tested on MacOSX 10.10 with Clang. My next goal
is support for Fedora Linux as well. Contributions gladly accepted. ;-)
